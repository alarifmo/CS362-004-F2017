*************BUG NO. 1 ********************
In when calling the adventurer card, an i implemented my test i got :
	
the hand count = 8 , The expected = 7, the deck = 0 , The expected= 2
the hand count = 8 , the expected=7, the deck = 0 , the expected= 3

The cards in hand and in the deck are being initilized in the test, this is why i know what should we expect. However, here we can see that in the teammate's code the deck got 0 cards while it should get 2 in the first time and 3 in the second. As well as for the handcount. 




*************BUG NO.2 ******************************
FOR the Smithy Function:


we know the Smithy card allow the player to draw 3 cards. so if the player have 5 cards, he will play one, and get 3
which will make the total = 5-1+3= 7

but in my teammate's code we can see that after running the test we will get:

the Number of cards in hand = 8, the expected =7 

so it either drawing 4 cards instead of 3 or the function did not discards the played card
